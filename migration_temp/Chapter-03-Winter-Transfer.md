# Winter Transfers: Strategic Leverage

## A rough beginning of 2025

As the team bid farewell with Lira and Coman, and a few other players, the season started to feel a bit more difficult.

### Transfer strategy going forward

Learning from the mistake of the first half of the season, I have decided to set some rules for the transfer window.

1. Player ratings must be below **70** <sup>(the average rating at Championship level)</sup> at the time of signing.
2. Have a more *diverse age profile*.
3. Prioritise players from the **British Isles**, or the **commonwealth**.

## Alexis Vega's Transfer Request

The chill of January seemed to seep into the training ground as **Alexis Vega** approached the coach after a particularly gruelling session. The Mexican striker's brow was furrowed, with a stern resolve. He demands for immediate action from the coach to make his transfer happen ASAP.

> **Inzaghi**: *"Alexis, of course. But we're top of the league, you're scoring goals... we're heading into the Championship. You've been brilliant for us."*
>
> **Vega**: *"The Championship isn't enough. I need to be in a league where my abilities are truly tested. I have ambition, Coach. I want to play in Europe, to compete for trophies. I'm wasting my time here."*

> **Inzaghi** frowned. *"Alexis, it's not that simple. We're counting on you."*
>
> **Vega**: *"The club made it happen for the others; now it's my turn. I've given you everything to get to this point. Now it's your turn to help me move on."*

> **Inzaghi** watched him leave, a knot forming in his stomach. 2025 is not going to be easy.

### A phone call home

Inzaghi pondered Vega's request, an idea sparking in his mind. Leveraging his connections, he gave his old friends at Milan a call. After a few transfers, **Zlatan Ibrahimović** was on the line.

He proposed a deal: Vega in exchange for an experienced player, past his prime but still capable of contributing in League One and soon in the Championship. **Alessandro Florenzi** was the specific target.

The departure of our loanees had left the O's with limited options at right-back. Inzaghi knew Milan had promising young talent in that position, and Florenzi had been sidelined since his cruciate ligament tear in July 2024.

Fortunately, the Milan management agreed. They were heavily reliant on Rafael Leão on the left wing, and Alexis Vega could provide valuable backup and competition. They quickly moved to convince Florenzi, and the deal was struck: Vega would head to Milan, with Florenzi joining Leyton Orient.

## Securing more reinforcements

The O's were not done yet. The teams management knew the squad needed more depth, and they had a plan. The long standing partnership between the O's and Tottenham Hotspur comes to the rescue once again.

While the two team were discussing the previously agreed exchange of Erik Lira for Jamie Donley and Josh Keeley, they also floated the idea of a loan spell for **Mikey Moore** and the transfer of **Luka Vušković**.

Mikey Moore, a 17-year-old English winger from Tottenham Hotspur, is considered one of the brightest prospects in English football. He has won it all at the U17 and U21 level, and has since then become Spurs' youngest-ever Premier League player. This impressive trajectory made securing his loan spell a straightforward decision for both clubs. It will provide him with valuable first-team experience and much needed reinforcement for the O's.

Luka Vušković's deal was more intricate. Spurs had already agreed with Hajduk Split for the transfer of the 20-year-old Croatian international in the summer of 2025 However, with the rise of Micky Van Der Van and Christian Romero, Spurs were unsure of Vušković's first team prospects. The North London team were also keen for Vušković to gain experience in English football sooner.

Hajduk Split, however, were unwilling to release him prematurely unless they could secure a suitable replacement. Inzaghi proposed a solution: offering the unsettled Jesús Angulo in exchange. An agreement was reached, paving the way for Vušković's arrival to west London ahead of schedule. 

The O's will give Spurs priority for Vušković's transfer in future windows, should they decide to acquire him.

The <i>anonymous</i> Singaporean Investment Company that is now the owner of Leyton Orient has also pulled its weight. They have orchestrated a move for the 24-year-old Singaporean-Thai footballer <b>Ben Davis</b> at a fee of £250,000. They aimed at strengthening ties with Singapore and expanding the club's brand presence in Asia.

IRL, Davis faced [challenges](https://mainstand.co.th/en/features/5/article/3158) with his home country. As a Singaporean male, he was required to serve two years of mandatory military service upon turning 18. He requested for deferment to pursue his football career but it was denied.

In this alternate reality, however, Davis' home country granted him exemption from military duty and he represents the Singapore Nation Football Team. Coupled with his prior experience in England with Fulham's academy and Oxford United, Davis's versatility and experience made him an attractive prospect for Leyton Orient, aligning perfectly with the owners' vision of fostering a connection with the Singaporean fanbase and tapping into new revenue streams in the Asian market.

> *The Thai Football league is not available in EA FC 25 unfortunately, meaning Ben Davis is not in the game by default. I had to manually add him to the game using Player Editor and "sacrificed" a youth player to make space for him.*

Finally, Leyton Orient secured the signing of 66-rated Italian CDM <b>Luca Lipani</b> from Serie B side Sassuolo, in a deal worth £1.08 million plus Sean Clare.

## Transfer Window: Mission Accomplished

The January transfer window proved to be a transformative period for the O's, marked by strategic decisions and calculated risks. The departures of Vega, Coman, Lira, and Angulo, while initially unsettling, were a deliberate move to recalibrate the squad's strength, addressing the issue of being excessively dominant for League One. These transfers allowed us to restore balance and create a more engaging and challenging gameplay experience.

A significant challenge was mitigating the impact of loanee recalls. However, we proactively countered this by securing both promising loan acquisitions and permanent signings. The arrival of seasoned players like Florenzi, coupled with the addition of highly-rated young talents such as Moore and Vušković, not only filled the immediate voids but also injected a renewed sense of quality and potential into the team.

Ultimately, the January transfer window can be declared a resounding success. The club adeptly navigated potential disruptions, strategically rebalanced the squad, and emerged with reinforced depth and quality.  These astute moves have not only maintained the promotion push but have also positioned the O's for continued success in the second half of the season and beyond.
