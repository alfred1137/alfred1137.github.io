# Double Delight!

## The Final Whistle Blows: Inzaghi's Debut Season Ends in Glory

As the dust settles on the 2024/25 season, we can look back on a truly remarkable debut campaign at the helm of Leyton Orient. After the challenges and adjustments mid-season the team responded magnificently, exceeding all expectations.

## League One Champions!

The race for the League One title went down to the wire, a thrilling battle primarily fought between ourselves and Birmingham City. We frequently traded places at the summit, but our consistency, particularly our incredible defensive resilience, proved decisive.

**We finished the season as *League One Champions*, securing automatic promotion to the Championship!**

Birmingham City pushed us all the way, finishing a close second with 96 points. Our superior defence, conceding a mere 11 goals across the entire 46-game league season, was the cornerstone of our success, providing the platform for crucial victories.

## Conquering Wembley: EFL Trophy Winners!

The final was a tense, cagey affair, reflecting the tight league battle we'd had all season. Chances were few and far between, but a single moment of quality decided it. We emerged **1-0 victors**, lifting the EFL Trophy to complete a fantastic league and cup double!

## A Perfect Start: Inzaghi's Double

Winning both the League One title and the EFL Trophy in my first season is beyond what I could have realistically hoped for.

It's a testament to the hard work of the players, the staff, and the unwavering support from the board and the fans. From the initial squad overhaul last summer to navigating the pressures of a promotion race and cup final, it has been a wonderful journey.

Promotion to the Championship was the target, and we've achieved it in style.

## Season 2024/25: Player Performance Highlights

Achieving a double requires contributions from across the entire squad, navigating a gruelling 61-match season across all competitions. While detailed statistics will be presented separately, let's highlight some key performers and trends from this unforgettable campaign.

The demands of the season meant rotation was crucial, but several players were near ever-presents. Winger _Aaron Nemane_ led the way with a remarkable 56 appearances, showcasing his durability and importance to our system. Midfield engine _Mihály Kata_ (48 appearances), attacking midfielders _Jamie Donley_ (47) and _Ethan Galbraith_ (46), and left-back _Bogdan Mykhailichenko_ (47) formed the core of the team, consistently featuring throughout the campaign. Their availability was vital to our success.

When it came to standout individual performances, goalkeeper _Josh Keeley_ was simply sensational. His average rating of 7.51 across the season, coupled with 10 Man of the Match awards, speaks volumes about his contribution between the sticks. In midfield, _Dele Alli_ (7.02 average rating, 6 MOTMs) proved his quality, providing moments of class and leadership. Upfront, strikers _Jay Stansfield_ (6.82 average rating, 5 MOTMs) and _Will Lankshear_ (6.62 average rating, 5 MOTMs) also delivered crucial match-winning performances.

Goals were arguably harder to come by than clean sheets this season, reflecting our defensive focus, but _Jay Stansfield_ led the line effectively, topping our scoring charts with 14 goals across all competitions. Fellow striker _Will Lankshear_ wasn't far behind, bagging 12 goals despite fewer appearances. Among our CAMs, _Dele Alli_ chipped in with 5 important goals from midfield, while _Ethan Galbraith_ and _Jamie Donley_ added 3 each, providing secondary scoring threats.

Creativity primarily came from the flanks and midfield. _Aaron Nemane_ complemented his high appearance count by leading the team with 8 assists, constantly providing width and delivery. Winger _Ollie O'Neill_ was another key provider with 7 assists. The influential _Dele Alli_ and tireless _Mihály Kata_ both registered 6 assists, demonstrating their ability to unlock defences, while striker _Will Lankshear_ also showed his creative side with 5 assists.

Our defensive record was the bedrock of our double win, and _Josh Keeley_ was the undisputed star. He kept an astonishing 45 clean sheets in his 57 appearances, conceding just 18 goals all season – a truly phenomenal record. Our academy keeper _Jamie Norman_ stepped in admirably when called upon in his 4 appearances conceding 3 goals.
