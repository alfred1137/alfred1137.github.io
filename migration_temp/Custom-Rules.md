# Custom Rule Set

Custom rules have been introduced in this gameplay to set the scene for immersion and to balance the game by imposing certain restrictions that were not present in the original game.

The game scenario is set in an alternate reality, starting from the summer of 2024.

## Starting Fund

In the summer of 2024, an anonymous Singaporean Investment Company made a move to take over Leyton Orient. They have injected **Â£10M** worth of fresh funds to elevate the squad.

## House Transfer Rules

These house transfer rules were introduced in the Winter Transfer Window of the first season (January 2025 in-game). The objective was to rebalance the game by limiting the ratings of players aggressively brought in during the summer transfer, which were clearly superior in comparison to those who were playing in League One at the time.

More details on this can be found in [Chapter 02](https://github.com/alfred1137/LOFC-CM-202503/wiki/Chapter-02-Progress-&-Redemption#the-task-ahead).

The rules are as follows:

## Squad Registration Rules

Many leagues in Europe have introduced squad registration rules to promote locally developed players and restrict teams from spending excessively to bring in top players. 

I have employed a mix of rules from the English, Spanish, and Italian leagues to impose more restrictions on myself. The rules are as follow.

### 1. Homegrown Players (8 or more)
This rule ensures that the squad has a strong core of players developed within the club or the national association. It encourages the development and integration of local talent, aligning with the club's long-term vision.

A minimum of **8** homegrown players are required in the squad, each from one of the following subcategories:

#### 1-A. Club-Trained Players (2 or more)
A club-trained player is one who has been developed within the Leyton Orient youth academy. The player must have spent **a minimum of 3 years** with the club **before** reaching the **age of 21**. 

A minimum of **2** such players is required.

#### 1-B. Association-Trained Players (6 or more)
An association-trained player is one who has been developed at clubs affiliated with the English or Welsh football associations. The player must have spent **a minimum of 3 years** in total with those clubs **before** reaching the **age of 21**. 

A minimum of **6** such players is required.

### 2. Foreign Players (5 or less)
This rule limits the number of foreign players in the squad, encouraging the integration of local talent. 

A maximum of **5** foreign players are allowed.

### 3. U-21 Players (no limit)
This rule allows for an unlimited number of U-21 players in the squad, encouraging the development and integration of young talent. It provides opportunities for promising young players to gain experience without any limitations on their nationalities or origin.
