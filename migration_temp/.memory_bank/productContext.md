# Product Context: Leyton Orient CM 202503 Wiki

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to chronicle a long-term save in EA FC 25, specifically managing **Leyton Orient**. The primary motivation is to document the journey from a lower league club to potential glory, capturing the highs and lows, strategic decisions, and the evolution of the squad. It serves as a personal archive for the manager (*Inzaghi*) and a potential source of entertainment and learning for other football management game enthusiasts.

## Problems It Solves
*   **Memory Aid:** Helps the manager remember key events, transfers, and tactical shifts across multiple in-game seasons.
*   **Strategic Review:** Provides a structured way to review past decisions and their outcomes, aiding in future strategic planning.
*   **Content Generation:** Serves as a basis for blog posts or articles, sharing the experience with a wider audience.
*   **Community Engagement:** Offers a detailed case study for discussions within the EA FC 25 community, allowing others to learn from or critique the managerial approach.

## How It Should Work
The wiki should be organized into chapters, each covering a specific period or season within the game. Each chapter should include:
*   **Narrative Flow:** A compelling story of the season's events, written in an enthusiastic and engaging tone.
*   **Key Match Summaries:** Highlights of important games, including results, goal scorers, and tactical notes.
*   **Transfer Windows:** Detailed breakdowns of incoming and outgoing transfers, including player profiles and transfer fees.
*   **Squad Analysis:** Regular assessments of player performance, development, and team cohesion.
*   **Financial Updates:** Snapshots of the club's financial status.
*   **Visuals:** Relevant screenshots from the game (e.g., league tables, player stats, match results) and custom graphics (e.g., kit designs).

## User Experience Goals
*   **Easy Navigation:** Readers should be able to easily navigate between chapters and sections.
*   **Engaging Content:** The content should be well-written, informative, and entertaining, encouraging readers to follow the journey.
*   **Visually Appealing:** The use of images and consistent formatting should make the wiki visually attractive and easy to digest.
*   **Insightful:** Readers should gain a deeper understanding of the game's mechanics and strategic considerations through the documented experience.
