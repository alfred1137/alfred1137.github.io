# Active Context: Leyton Orient CM 202503 Wiki

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on documenting the ongoing managerial career with **Leyton Orient** in EA FC 25. This involves regularly updating the wiki with new chapters, transfer summaries, and tactical analyses as the in-game seasons progress. The goal is to keep the documentation as close to real-time as possible with the game's progression.

## Recent Changes
*   **Chapter Updates:** New chapters (e.g., `Chapter-09-Championship-Grind.md`, `Chapter-10-Season-3-Prologue.md`, `Chapter-11-S3-Summer-Transfer.md`) have been added, detailing recent in-game seasons and events.
*   **Transfer Summaries:** Updated transfer sections with new player arrivals and departures, particularly for the latest summer transfer window (Season 3).
*   **Resource Integration:** New images and PDF documents related to squad statistics, transfer activities, and kit designs have been added to the `Resources/` directory.
*   **Style Guide Adherence:** Efforts are being made to ensure all new content adheres to the `BlogStyle.md` and `NameFormat.md` guidelines for consistency.

## Next Steps
*   **Continue Chapter Documentation:** Create new chapters for the upcoming in-game seasons, focusing on key matches, player performances, and tactical adjustments.
*   **Detailed Player Profiles:** Consider adding more in-depth profiles for key players, especially those who are developing rapidly or making a significant impact.
*   **Financial Deep Dive:** Provide more detailed financial breakdowns, including revenue, expenses, and budget management.
*   **Community Interaction:** Explore ways to engage with the CM community, perhaps by soliciting feedback or answering questions based on the wiki's content.
*   **Review and Refine Existing Content:** Periodically review older chapters to ensure accuracy, consistency, and adherence to the evolving style guide.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
*   **Image Hosting:** Confirming the use of `https://github.com/alfred1137/LOFC-CM-202503/wiki/Resources/` as the root for image paths to ensure proper rendering on GitHub Wiki.
*   **Collapsible Sections:** Implementing collapsible sections for lengthy details (e.g., loan player descriptions) to improve readability.
*   **Managerial Voice:** Maintaining the personal and enthusiastic voice of *Inzaghi* throughout the narrative.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
*   **British English:** All content should be written in British English.
*   **Bold for Club Names:** Club names (e.g., **Leyton Orient**) should be bolded.
*   **Italics for Individual Names:** Individual player or staff names (e.g., *Mikey Moore*) should be italicized.
*   **Managerial Reference:** Refer to the manager as *Filippo Inzaghi* or *Inzaghi*, and use `I/me/my` interchangeably when referring to the AI's role as the manager.

## Learnings and Project Insights
*   The free transfer market has been extensively exploited to strengthen the squad, bringing in national team players from unrepresented leagues. This approach has significant upsides in terms of squad quality but also potential downsides (e.g., wage bill, team cohesion).
*   Immediate squad overhaul was necessary at the start of the save to implement a dynamic, attacking tactical vision built on a solid defensive foundation.
