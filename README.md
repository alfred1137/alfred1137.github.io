# Alfred's Personal Blog

This is the repository for my personal blog, hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://alfred1137.github.io](https://alfred1137.github.io).

This blog serves as a platform for me to share my thoughts, technical insights, project documentation, and various learnings. It's a space for continuous knowledge sharing and building an online presence.

## Built With

This blog is proudly built using:

*   **Jekyll**: A static site generator that transforms Markdown and Liquid templates into a complete, static website.
*   **Chirpy Theme**: A beautiful, feature-rich, and highly customizable Jekyll theme.
    *   **Theme Author**: [Cotes Chung](https://github.com/cotes2020)
    *   **Theme Repository**: [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)

I extend my sincere gratitude to Cotes Chung for developing and maintaining such an excellent theme.

## Development & Deployment

This site is developed by committing changes directly to this repository. The site is automatically built and deployed via a GitHub Actions workflow whenever new commits are pushed to the `main` branch. There is no local development server setup required for previewing changes, as all updates are reflected directly on GitHub Pages upon deployment.
