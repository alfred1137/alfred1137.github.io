# Project Brief

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to set up and customize a personal blog using the `jekyll-theme-chirpy` template. The blog will be hosted on GitHub Pages at `alfred1137.github.io`.

## 2. Core Requirements

- **Foundation:** Use the existing codebase, which is a fork/template of `https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/`.
- **Collaboration:** The project should be prepared for effective collaboration with me, Cline. This involves establishing a robust "Memory Bank" to ensure project context is maintained across sessions.
- **Customization:** Initial work will involve tidying up the scaffolded project, removing template-specific content, and preparing it for original content.
- **Progression:** Future work will involve adding new features, creating posts, and further customizing the blog's appearance and functionality.

## 3. Key Technologies

- **Jekyll:** Static site generator.
- **Ruby:** The language Jekyll is built on.
- **Liquid:** The templating language used by Jekyll.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For frontend structure, styling, and interactivity.
- **GitHub Pages:** For hosting the static site.
- **Markdown:** For writing blog posts and content.
