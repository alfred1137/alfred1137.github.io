# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on the initial setup and preparation of the `jekyll-theme-chirpy` template for a new personal blog. This involves:
- Establishing the Memory Bank for effective collaboration.
- Cleaning up the default template files and content.
- Customizing the core configuration (`_config.yml`) for the user's blog.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Content Creation Guide Added:** Created `memory-bank/content-creation-guide.md` to document the process of writing new posts, including front matter, media handling, and advanced formatting.
- **Design Guidelines Updated:** Updated `memory--bank/design-guidelines.md` with a comprehensive guide to all typography, formatting, and rich content options available in the theme.
- **Memory Bank Established:** All core Memory Bank files have been created.
- **Initial Clean up:**
    - Removed placeholder file from `_posts/`.
    - Updated `README.md` with project-specific information.
    - Personalized `_config.yml`.
    - Updated `_tabs/about.md`.
- **Workflow Clarification:** The development and deployment workflow has been clarified. All changes will be committed directly and deployed via GitHub Actions. The Memory Bank (`techContext.md`, `README.md`) has been updated to reflect this.

## 3. Next Steps

The initial project setup and documentation phase is complete. The project is ready for content creation. The next steps are:
1.  **Customize Data Files:** Review and update `_data/contact.yml` and `_data/share.yml` with the user's information.
2.  **Customize Assets:** Replace the default avatar at `assets/img/avatar.png` and the site favicon.
3.  **Create First Post:** Create a new blog post in the `_posts` directory, using the `content-creation-guide.md` and `design-guidelines.md` as references.
4.  **Review and Refine:** Once the initial setup is complete, review the live site and make any necessary adjustments.

## 4. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Memory Bank First:** All significant changes or new discoveries about the project should be documented in the Memory Bank to ensure continuity.
- **Systematic Approach:** Changes should be made methodically, starting with configuration, then content, then assets.
