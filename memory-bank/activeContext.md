# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on preparing the blog's groundwork before starting to upload blog posts. This involves:
- Establishing the Memory Bank for effective collaboration.
- Cleaning up the default template files and content.
- Customizing the core configuration (`_config.yml`) for the user's blog.
- Setting up initial data files and a placeholder post.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Content Creation Guide Added:** Created `memory-bank/content-creation-guide.md` to document the process of writing new posts, including front matter, media handling, and advanced formatting.
- **Design Guidelines Updated:** Updated `memory--bank/design-guidelines.md` with a comprehensive guide to all typography, formatting, and rich content options available in the theme.
- **Memory Bank Established:** All core Memory Bank files have been created.
- **Initial Configuration & Content Groundwork:**
    - Removed placeholder file from `_posts/`.
    - Updated `README.md` with project-specific information.
    - Personalized `_config.yml` with blog title, tagline, description, Twitter, and email.
    - Updated `_data/contact.yml` to include LinkedIn and Stack Overflow links.
    - Updated `_data/share.yml` to include LinkedIn and Reddit sharing options.
    - Updated `_tabs/about.md` with personalized information and social links.
    - Created a placeholder first blog post: `_posts/2025-07-27-first-blog-post.md`.
- **Workflow Clarification:** The development and deployment workflow has been clarified. All changes will be committed directly and deployed via GitHub Actions. The Memory Bank (`techContext.md`, `README.md`) has been updated to reflect this.

## 3. Next Steps

The initial project setup and content groundwork phase is largely complete. The remaining steps for groundwork are:
1.  **Customize Assets:** Replace the site favicon (if not already done).
2.  **Rewrite README:** Rewrite the `README.md` to describe the personal blog project, not the theme template.
3.  **Begin Content Creation:** Start creating actual blog posts.

## 4. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Memory Bank First:** All significant changes or new discoveries about the project should be documented in the Memory Bank to ensure continuity.
- **Systematic Approach:** Changes should be made methodically, starting with configuration, then content, then assets.
