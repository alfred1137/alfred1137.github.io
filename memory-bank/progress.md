# Project Progress

## 1. What Works

- **Repository:** The GitHub repository is set up.
- **Theme Foundation:** The `jekyll-theme-chirpy` is in place and the basic file structure is present.
- **Memory Bank:** The core documentation structure for our collaboration is now established.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Branding:**
    - The site's favicon needs to be replaced (if not already done).
- **README:** The `README.md` needs to be rewritten to describe the personal blog project, not the theme template.
- **Content:**
    - Create actual blog posts.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Initial Setup & Content Groundwork.
- **Next Milestone:** Rewrite the `README.md` and begin creating actual blog posts.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.
