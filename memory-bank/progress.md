# Project Progress

## 1. What Works

- **Repository:** The GitHub repository is set up.
- **Theme Foundation:** The `jekyll-theme-chirpy` is in place and the basic file structure is present.
- **Memory Bank:** The core documentation structure for our collaboration is now established.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Configuration:** The `_config.yml` file needs to be customized with the user's specific details (name, URL, social links, etc.).
- **Content:**
    - The placeholder post in `_posts` needs to be removed.
    - The `about.md` page needs to be personalized.
    - The `contact.yml` and `share.yml` data files need to be updated.
- **Branding:**
    - The site's favicon needs to be replaced.
    - The author's avatar needs to be added.
- **README:** The `README.md` needs to be rewritten to describe the personal blog project, not the theme template.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase:** Initial Setup & Scaffolding.
- **Next Milestone:** Complete the initial configuration and content cleanup.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.
