# Progress

## What Works
- The plan for migrating blog posts from `D:\Git\LOFC-CM-202503.wiki` to the current blog has been drafted, accepted, and documented in the memory bank.
- The decision has been made to create a copy of the source repository for migration purposes.

## What's Left to Build
- **Prepare Source Data:**
    - A secure, separate copy of the source repository (`D:\Git\LOFC-CM-202503.wiki`) is available at `migration_temp`. This copy will be kept isolated from the project files of the new blog.
    - Gather blog post files, their content, creation dates, assets from the `/Resource` folder, and the `/.clinerules`/`/memory-bank` content from this copied repository.
- **Execute Migration (Step-by-Step):**
    - **Step 1: Process Chapter 00 (Home Page):**
        - Merge `migration_temp/Club-Profile.md` and `migration_temp/Custom-Rules.md` into `migration_temp/Home.md`.
        - The combined `Home.md` will be treated as "Chapter 00" and placed in the `_posts/` directory.
        - Discard `migration_temp/_Footer.md`.
        - *Await user acceptance for Chapter 00 before proceeding.*
    - **Step 2: Process Blog Posts (Iterative):**
        - For each subsequent chapter markdown file (e.g., `Chapter-01-Down-the-Brisbane-Road.md`) in `migration_temp/`:
            - Extract the chapter number (e.g., "01" from "Chapter-01-").
            - Extract the chapter title (e.g., "Down-the-Brisbane-Road" from "Chapter-01-Down-the-Brisbane-Road.md").
            - Use the following to date the chapters being migrated:
                - CH01: 2025-03-17 (YYYY-MM-DD)
                - CH02: 2025-03-18
                - CH03: 2025-03-22
                - CH04: 2025-03-23
                - CH05: 2025-04-03
                - CH06: 2025-04-07
                - CH07: 2025-04-08
                - CH08: 2025-04-14
                - CH09: 2025-06-13
                - CH10: 2025-06-18
                - CH11: 2025-06-23
                - CH12: 2025-07-26
            - Migrate the markdown content to `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-LOFC-CM-CH<chapter_number>`.
            - Assets from `migration_temp/Resources/` will be organized under `assets/LOFC-CM-CH<chapter_number>/`.
            - *Await user acceptance for each chapter before proceeding to the next.*
    - **Step 3: Migrate Configuration Directories:**
        - The contents of `migration_temp/.clinerules/` will be merged into the project's root `.clinerules/`, prioritizing existing files to avoid overwriting current rules.
        - Similarly, `migration_temp/.memory_bank/` will be merged into the project's root `.memory_bank/`, prioritizing existing files.
        - *Await user acceptance after migrating configuration directories.*
- **Review and Refine:** Address any conflicts or issues found in migrated project-specific files.
- **Cleanup:** Delete the copied source repository once the user confirms satisfaction with the entire migration.

## Current Status
- Chapter 00 migration is complete and successfully deployed.
- The file `_posts/2025-03-06-LOFC-CM-CH00.md` is correctly named and contains the corrected content, including the external link to `https://www.leytonorient.com`.
- The banner image has been correctly placed at `assets/img/LOFC-CM-CH00/Banner.png`.
- `html-proofer` errors related to the image path and the external link have been resolved.
- Chapter 01 migration is complete.
- Chapter 02 migration is complete.
- Chapter 03 migration is complete.

- **Current State:** Chapter 00, Chapter 01, Chapter 02, and Chapter 03 are migrated, deployed, and all identified `html-proofer` errors are resolved. The fix for missing image alt attributes has been verified through successful redeployment.
- **Lesson Learned:** Ensure all images within post content have descriptive `alt` attributes for accessibility and to prevent deployment errors, even if not explicitly detailed in all theme guides.
- **Title Format Rule:** Colons (`:`) are not allowed in post titles. Use hyphens (`-`) or pipes (`|`) as separators instead.

## Known Issues
- The original plan noted potential issues with direct access to the source repository. By creating a copy, we aim to mitigate these concerns. Any remaining issues will be addressed during the migration and review phases.
