# Progress

## What Works
- The plan for migrating blog posts from `D:\Git\LOFC-CM-202503.wiki` to the current blog has been drafted, accepted, and documented in the memory bank.
- The decision has been made to create a copy of the source repository for migration purposes.

## What's Left to Build
- **Prepare Source Data:**
    - A secure, separate copy of the source repository (`D:\Git\LOFC-CM-202503.wiki`) is available at `migration_temp`. This copy will be kept isolated from the project files of the new blog.
    - Gather blog post files, their content, creation dates, assets from the `/Resource` folder, and the `/.clinerules`/`/memory-bank` content from this copied repository.
    - all posts (in .md) and folders created under this migration should be prefixed with "LOFC-CM-".
- **Execute Migration (Step-by-Step):**
    - **Step 1: Process Chapter 00 (Home Page):**
        - Merge `migration_temp/Club-Profile.md` and `migration_temp/Custom-Rules.md` into `migration_temp/Home.md`.
        - The combined `Home.md` will be treated as "Chapter 00" and placed in the `_posts/` directory.
        - Discard `migration_temp/_Footer.md`.
        - *Await user acceptance for Chapter 00 before proceeding.*
    - **Step 2: Process Blog Posts (Iterative):**
        - For each subsequent chapter markdown file (e.g., `Chapter-01-Down-the-Brisbane-Road.md`) in `migration_temp/`:
            - Extract the chapter number (e.g., "01" from "Chapter-01-").
            - Extract the chapter title (e.g., "Down-the-Brisbane-Road" from "Chapter-01-Down-the-Brisbane-Road.md").
            - Migrate the markdown content to `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-LOFC-CM-CH<chapter_number>`.
            - Assets from `migration_temp/Resources/` will be organized under `assets/LOFC-CM-CH<chapter_number>/`.
            - *Await user acceptance for each chapter before proceeding to the next.*
    - **Step 3: Migrate Configuration Directories:**
        - The contents of `migration_temp/.clinerules/` will be merged into the project's root `.clinerules/`, prioritizing existing files to avoid overwriting current rules.
        - Similarly, `migration_temp/.memory_bank/` will be merged into the project's root `.memory_bank/`, prioritizing existing files.
        - *Await user acceptance after migrating configuration directories.*
- **Review and Refine:** Address any conflicts or issues found in migrated project-specific files.
- **Cleanup:** Delete the copied source repository once the user confirms satisfaction with the entire migration.

## Current Status
- Chapter 00 (Home Page) has been created as `_posts/2025-03-06-LOFC-CM-CH00.md`. (Corrected filename)
- The banner image has been copied to `assets/img/LOFC-CM-CH00/Banner.png` and its path updated in the post.
- User feedback regarding image handling (migrating specific external assets while keeping others external) has been incorporated.
- Ready to proceed with Step 2: Process Blog Posts (Iterative).

## Known Issues
- The original plan noted potential issues with direct access to the source repository. By creating a copy, we aim to mitigate these concerns. Any remaining issues will be addressed during the migration and review phases.
- **File Naming Convention:** A mistake was made in the initial filename for Chapter 00. The correct Jekyll format `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md` must be strictly followed. The prefix `LOFC-CM-` should not be part of the filename itself but rather handled within the content or title if necessary. The corrected filename for Chapter 00 is `_posts/2025-03-06-LOFC-CM-CH00.md`.
