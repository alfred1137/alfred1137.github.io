# Levelling Up: **Leyton Orient**'s Return to the Championship!

It's been an incredible journey, and the dream has become reality! After a 40-year absence, **Leyton Orient** is back in the second tier of the English football pyramid – a feat last achieved in the 1981/82 season. The echoes of history are calling, and we're ready to answer!

The summer kicked off with welcome news: the board acknowledged the success of *Inzaghi*'s first year at the helm and confirmed my stay for the upcoming Championship campaign. The challenge ahead is immense, but the excitement is palpable.

## Navigating the Summer Transfer Window: New Challenges, New Heights

Stepping up to the Championship brings a fresh set of hurdles:

1.  **New Squad Registration Rules:** We'll need to adapt to the stricter requirements of the higher division.
2.  **Holding Onto Our Stars:** The harsh reality is that if a significant bid arrives for our players, we'll likely have to accept.
3.  **Strengthening the Squad:** The relentless Championship schedule demands greater depth and quality.

No sooner had the transfer window creaked open than challenge #2 hit us like a thunderbolt.

## Brace for Impact: Big Bids Arrive for League One Heroes

Several players who were instrumental in our promotion triumph attracted serious attention from top-flight clubs:

### *Tyler Bindon* | CB
Valued at £7,000,000, 71-rated *Bindon* attracted a £11,200,000 offer from **Atlético Madrid**. The phenomenal young talent was a rock at the back, playing 39 games and anchoring our defense whenever fit.

### *Mihály Kata* | CM
Valued at £4,100,000, 72-rated received a staggering £10,200,000 bid from **Brentford**. *Kata*, our vice-captain since arriving as a free agent, was immense last season. He featured in over 45 games, contributing 6 crucial assists and a goal from our double pivot. His departure leaves a significant void.

### *Bogdan Mykhailichenko* | LB
Valued at £1,900,000, 72-rated *Mykhailichenko* attracted a £3,600,000 offer from **Udinese**. *Mykhailichenko* was our first-choice left-back, playing 47 games.

### *Elijah Just* | RW
Valued at £1,900,000, 67-rated *Just* drew a £2,000,000 bid from **Luton Town**. *Just* served as a reliable backup right winger, making 26 appearances and providing 4 assists. His contributions were vital in providing squad depth and maintaining performance levels when called upon.

A part of me clung to the hope that personal terms might prove a stumbling block. However, facing offers from clubs of such stature, providing career-defining opportunities, it was inevitable. No player plying their trade in the third tier could realistically turn down such a massive step up.

This meant a top priority shifted immediately: finding worthy replacements for these key figures became paramount.

### Summary of Outgoings

Including the big bids, we bid farewell to the following players:

Among which *Joshua Eaton*, *Hisashi Yamura*, *Jayden Dalton* are academy products.

These departures, totaling 7 players in the senior squad, generated significant funds, which were reinvested to strengthen the squad.

## Securing the Future: Pre-Agreed Deals Locked In

Amidst the departures, there was positive movement. Last season, we secured loan deals for *Dele Alli* from **Como**, and *Mikey Moore* and *Will Lankshear* from **Spurs**, both with pre-agreed purchase options.

The first order of business for *Filippo Inzaghi*, was to activate these clauses and make their moves permanent. Bringing *Dele*, *Moore* and *Lankshear* back to Brisbane Road provides crucial continuity and firepower as we embark on our Championship adventure.

In addition to the above, We welcomed several new faces to Brisbane Road, bolstering our ranks for the challenges ahead:

### *Dele Alli*: Loan Star Shines Bright

*Dele Alli*'s loan spell was nothing short of sensational. As captain, he led the team in 41 games, earning an impressive 6 Man of the Match awards. His contributions on the pitch were equally significant, with 5 goals and 6 assists.

Thanks to EA's new dynamic potential feature, *Dele*'s remarkable resurgence was duly recognized with a **+6** potential boost. At 29 years old, he's not just spearheading **Leyton Orient**'s charge to the top flight; he might just be mounting a final push for a coveted spot in the national team.

## Pre-Season and Tactical Adjustments

Pre-season was used to integrate the new signings and refine our tactical approach for the Championship. 

We focused on maintaining our attacking philosophy while improving our defensive solidity. Unfortunately, we didn't win the pre-season trophy; but progress in integrating the new player is clear.

The Championship is a demanding league, and we'll need to be adaptable and resilient to compete effectively. Our aim is to establish ourselves in the division and build a foundation for future success.

## The Journey Continues...

Returning to the Championship after four decades is a monumental achievement for **Leyton Orient**. While the summer transfer window presented significant challenges with the departure of key promotion heroes, it also brought opportunities. We've reinvested wisely, secured vital signings, and welcomed promising new talent to strengthen the squad.

Pre-season has been crucial for integrating these new faces and adapting our tactics for the tougher competition ahead. The step up is undeniable, but so is our determination. *Filippo Inzaghi* and the squad are ready to embrace the challenge, fight for every point, and prove that **the O's** belong at this level. The atmosphere at Brisbane Road is electric, and we can't wait to kick off the new season. The journey is far from over; in many ways, it's just beginning!
