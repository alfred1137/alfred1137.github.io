# A reality check

IRL, it is March 2025. EA has just dropped two title updates within the span of 7 days. Many of the mods I was using were broken by the updates, and the modders were scrambling to catch up. That forced me into taking a break from the game, and it kind of renewed my dedication to the game.

In-game, we also find ourselves in March 2025, and I've just passed Inzaghi's **50th** match in charge of Leyton Orient.  

It's clear that the winter transfer window and squad rebalancing have significantly increased the difficulty.  Since January, we've experienced a noticeable shift in momentum, suffering two defeats in just 2-months' time – a stark contrast to our previous form.

## The Real Challenge Emerges

The recent squad adjustments have introduced a crucial new dimension to our matches.  

Individual player skill alone is no longer sufficient to guarantee victory. Games now demand a more nuanced and sophisticated tactical approach.  

To maintain our winning trajectory, we must now prioritise intricate passing sequences and intelligent player movement.

### International call-ups

The start of the year has also brought the challenge of international call-ups, impacting a significant portion of our first-team squad:

| Player name          | Nationality         | Rating | Position | Starting XI |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Kristofer Horvath     | Hungary              | 69     | RM       | N           |
| Mihály Kata           | Hungary              | 72     | CM       | Y           |
| Tyler Bindon          | New Zealand          | 69     | CB       | Y           |
| Ethan Galbraith        | Northern Ireland     | 68     | CAM      | N           |
| Josh Keeley           | Republic of Ireland  | 66     | GK       | Y           |
| Bogdan Mykhailichenko | Ukraine              | 72     | LB       | Y           |

With almost all of these players being regular starters, their absence for international duty has created considerable gaps in the team.  This is further compounded by the congested fixture schedule of the English leagues.  At certain points, maintaining a 100% fit squad for each match became a real struggle.

## FA Cup Exit at the Hands of Everton

We drew against Everton in our journey in the FA Cup. The tie against the Merseyside was a stark illustration of this heightened challenge.  For many of our players, facing a Premier League side represented a significant step up in competition.  Despite fielding our strongest available eleven and competing well in patches, Everton's superior quality ultimately proved decisive.

Their defense was well-organized and difficult to break down, while their attacks were fluid and incisive.  The shot count reflected their dominance: 15 shots to our 4.  Despite our best efforts, we conceded a goal from O'Brien and lost 1-0.  This defeat marks our exit from the FA Cup.

While the result is disappointing, we must now refocus our efforts on our league campaign.

## League One Position: A Tight Race

Returning to League One, Leyton Orient and Birmingham City remain locked in a tight battle at the top of the table, frequently exchanging first and second place as results fluctuate.  

As of this chapter, Leyton Orient holds a slender 2-point advantage over Birmingham, with a record of 24 wins, 10 draws, and 3 losses, accumulating 82 points.

However, league fixtures are no longer straightforward encounters. We've found ourselves conceding more goals after taking the lead compared to the first half of the season, leading to dropped points.

Notably, we suffered our first league defeat in a considerable time against Charlton Athletic F.C. away from home, losing 2-1 to the ninth-placed side.

Analysing the league standings, Leyton Orient's primary advantage over our rivals remains our defensive solidity.  Our goal difference stands at 41 goals scored and a mere 7 conceded.  In comparison, second-placed Birmingham boasts 72 goals for but 38 against, with most other teams also scoring and conceding around 40 goals.  

Overall it feels more like a simulation problem then anything.

## Performance stats

Here's a summary of our performance during our first 50 games in charge of the O's.
