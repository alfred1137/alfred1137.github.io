# Season 3 Prologue

## Introduction
As we march into our second Championship season, the board's expectations are soaring after last season's incredible journey! *Filippo Inzaghi* faces a formidable challenge with a set of season objectives that truly reflect our ambition:

1.  Secure automatic promotion to the Premier League.
2.  Reach the semi-finals in one of the domestic cups.

This marks a significant step up from last year's mid-table objective, highlighting the scale of the task ahead!

## Player Upgrades
With the new season dawning, *Inzaghi* eagerly delved into the updated player ratings – a true testament to the hard work and dedication of our squad!

EA FC 25 Career Mode's dynamic player potential has truly blessed **the O's**, with individual player performance and ability now reflected in their refreshed overalls.

The standout story has to be *Will Lankshear*! Our prolific striker has exploded onto the scene, his overall rating surging from a promising 67 to an incredible 79 (+12!) in the last 12 months!

This massive leap confirms what we already knew – *Lankshear* is ready to lead the line and strike fear into Championship defences.

We've seen a fantastic collective surge across the squad, with several players seeing improvements in their overall ratings:

*   *Peyton Miller*: 65 to 72 (+7)
*   *Jamie Norman*: 61 to 65 (+4)
*   *Harrison Armstrong* (away on loan last season): 66 to 70 (+4)
*   *Omari Kellyman* (away on loan last season): 66 to 69 (+3)
*   *Mikey Moore*: 74 to 76 (+2)
*   *Marko Stamenic*: 77 to 78 (+1)
*   *Luka Vušković*: 75 to 76 (+1)
*   *Jamie Donley*: 72 to 73 (+1)

Crucially, the most significant improvements have come from our youngest players, who are rapidly catching up to the rest of the squad and are now valid competitors for starting spots, not just backups.

Slightly older players like *Jamie Donley* and *Marko Stamenic* need to continue to raise the bar to push the team forward.

The improvement aren't just about numbers; they about our players maturing, gelling, and proving they have what it takes to compete at the highest level. These upgrades are a huge confidence boost and set the stage for an electrifying season!

## Other Notable Player Movements
The end of an era: our stalwart defender, *Omar Beckles*, has retired from professional football.

### Farewell, Omar Beckles

*Omar Beckles* is an English-born professional footballer of Grenadian descent. He played as a defender for **Leyton Orient** in EFL League One at the time of *Inzaghi*'s appointment. Born on 25 October 1991 in Leytonstone, London, *Beckles* enjoyed a diverse club career spanning Spain, non-league English football, and the English Football League. He was the veteran in the club and a leader in the dressing room.

Throughout his time with **the O's** in this save, *Beckles* has been a solid rotation option at the back. Despite his overall rating seeing a natural decline over the past two seasons, his presence remained commanding, consistently winning crucial headers and providing invaluable leadership to our defence.

### Dele working his way back to his former self

On the other hand, *Dele Alli* has unfortunately passed his prime despite all the attention he's received and can no longer improve. Our focus with *Dele* will now shift to maintaining his current level.

He also sadly missed out on the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America, the national team call-up that he had tirelessly trained for since joining us.

As *Dele* chatted with *Inzaghi*, it's clear his career focus is now firmly set on leading **the O's** into the top flight.

Smart business in the summer transfer window will be critical for success in the new season. Significant squad strengthening is essential if we're to truly charge for Premier League glory.

At the same time, many clubs are already eyeing our top-performing players, and depending on who gets poached, we'll need to find suitable replacements.
