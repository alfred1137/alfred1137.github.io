# Chapter 12: Half-Season Review & Winter Transfer Window - Season 3

## Introduction

The journey of **Leyton Orient** in Season 3 of the EFL Championship has been nothing short of exhilarating. *Inzaghi* led the relentless pursuit of promotion, navigating the demanding schedule and the fierce competition of the league. This chapter reviews my progress in the first half of the season, highlighting key performances, my tactical insights, and the crucial movements I made in the January transfer window that have shaped our path forward. The dream of reaching the Premier League is palpable, and every decision I've made is geared towards making that a reality.

## Season 3: First Half Performance – A Promotion Push

The first half of Season 3 saw us, **Leyton Orient**, establish ourselves as serious contenders for automatic promotion. By the end of January 2027, and carrying into February, I was thrilled to see us achieve a remarkable 2nd place in the EFL Championship, standing with 74 points from 32 games. We trailed **Ipswich** by a mere 2 points (76 points), a testament to our exceptionally strong start and consistent form.

### Cup Competitions

The cup campaigns provided mixed fortunes but valuable experience:

*   **Carabao Cup:** I was pleased with our strong form, as we progressed through multiple rounds.
    *   Round 1: A convincing 2-0 victory against *Oxford United* in August 2026.
    *   Round 2: A dominant 3-0 win over *Blackburn* in late August 2026.
    *   Round 3: Our journey concluded in a narrow 2-1 defeat to Premier League giants **Manchester City** in late September 2026. This was a commendable run against top-tier opposition, demonstrating our growing capabilities. Our only goal scored was a wonder freekick from distant by *Will Lankshear*.

*   **FA Cup:** Our FA Cup campaign was short-lived, with an early exit.
    *   Round 4: A 1-0 loss to *Wrexham* in late January 2027.

### Memorable Matches

The league campaign was filled with highs and a few challenging moments for me:

*   **Wins:**
    *   Significant cup wins against *Oxford United* (2-0, Carabao R1) and *Blackburn* (3-0, Carabao R2) showcased our ability to perform on the knockout stage.
    *   A commanding 4-0 home win against *Watford* in September 2026.
    *   A crucial 3-1 away win against *Cardiff* in November 2026.
    *   A dominant 5-0 home win against *Oxford United* in the league in late January 2027, demonstrating strong attacking prowess.

*   **Losses:**
    *   The narrow 2-1 Carabao Cup defeat to **Manchester City** in September 2026 stands out as a tough but respectable exit.
    *   A 3-0 away loss to *Bristol City* in October 2026.
    *   A 3-2 away loss to *Birmingham* in January 2027, marking a stumble at the start of the new year.
    *   The FA Cup Fourth Round loss to *Wrexham* (1-0) in late January 2027.

*   **Draws:**
    *   Several draws, including 1-1 against *Oxford United* (August), 2-2 against *Reading* (August), 1-1 against *Hull* (October), and 1-1 against *Middlesbrough* (January), pointed to our tenacity but also highlighted missed opportunities to convert draws into wins.

### Tactical Successes and Challenges

My consistent high league position (2nd by February) points to exceptional overall tactical success. The team demonstrated strong scoring ability (75 goals scored in 39 matches prior to February's games), indicating a potent attacking system that I've worked hard to implement. Our ability to win cup games against good opposition also showed our tactical adaptability. The 14 total clean sheets (9 by *Keeley*, 5 by *Norman*) across the 39 matches suggest a developing defensive structure under my guidance, improving from earlier in the season.

However, challenges remain. While our attack excels, the 37 goals conceded in 39 matches (nearly a goal per game average) signifies that defensive solidity, while improving, remains an area I am actively addressing. The calendar indicated a few periods of inconsistent form, particularly a dip in December and early January where losses started to creep in (e.g., 1-3 to *Portsmouth*, 0-2 to *Sunderland*, 2-3 to *Birmingham*). Managing fatigue and maintaining consistency across a demanding Championship schedule appears to be an ongoing challenge for me. The FA Cup exit also indicated a potential struggle in navigating multiple competitions simultaneously.

## Key Player Performances

Several players truly shone in the first half of Season 3, driving our promotion push, and I'm incredibly proud of their efforts:

*   ***Will Lankshear:*** A revelation, leading the "Top Players" list with an outstanding 8.12 average rating and 8 Man of the Match awards. He is also the second top scorer with 15 goals despite only 15 appearances, highlighting clinical finishing.
*   ***Jay Stansfield:*** Continues to be a pivotal figure as the top goal scorer with 20 goals and a very strong 7.57 average rating, earning 8 Man of the Match awards. He also contributed significantly to assists.
*   ***Dele Alli:*** A key creative force, leading the team with 10 assists and contributing 6 goals from 24 appearances. His influence in midfield remains central.
*   ***Hannibal:*** Quickly integrated and impressed, holding an average rating of 6.78 with 3 Man of the Match awards and 8 assists in just 28 appearances (his transfer happened mid-season, reflecting immediate impact).
*   ***Jamie Donley:*** Maintained his creative output with 7 assists and contributed from his 26 appearances.
*   ***Josh Keeley:*** The primary goalkeeper, recording 9 clean sheets and conceding 30 goals.
*   ***Marko Stamenić:*** Demonstrated his importance in midfield with 29 appearances (most among outfield players) and 6 assists.
*   ***Tyreece Simpson:*** Despite only 12 appearances, contributed 6 goals, showing promising attacking efficiency.
*   ***Luka Vušković:*** A defensive presence, featuring in 24 games and even chipping in with 4 goals.

### Injuries and Underperformers

While the provided data doesn't explicitly name underperforming players, given the significant number of departures (17 total), it's plausible that some of these outgoing players may have been deemed surplus to requirements due to performance or fit within my system prior to their transfer. The high number of goals conceded (37 in 39 games played) suggests that while individuals stood out, consistent defensive collective performance might have seen struggles at times.

A significant setback for me was the long-term injury to *Rosas* around Christmas, which unfortunately forced us to acquire a new right-back in the transfer window.

## Winter Transfer Window (January 2027)

The January transfer window was a period of significant activity for **Leyton Orient**, marked by strategic investments and shrewd financial management. I aimed to bolster the squad for the promotion push and future Premier League aspirations.

### Key Incoming Transfers

*   ***Ben Doak***
    *   Position: RM | RW (Winger)
    *   Age: 20
    *   Previous club: **Inter**
    *   Transfer fee: £28.9M (Value: €31M, Wage: €55K)
*   Rationale: A massive investment signalling my clear intent for promotion. I see *Doak* as an explosive attacking talent to bolster **Leyton Orient's** forward line, potentially adding pace, flair, and direct goal threat crucial for a promotion push and future Premier League aspirations. His high potential (86) and current rating (78) make him a key long-term asset for me.

*   ***Hannibal***
    *   Position: CM | CAM (Midfielder)
    *   Age: 23
    *   Previous club: **Burnley**
    *   Transfer fee: *Ethan Galbraith* + £7.6M (part-exchange deal, valuing *Galbraith* at around £8M as well) (Value: €11.5M, Wage: €41K)
*   Rationale: A swap deal that brings in a versatile, high-energy midfielder. I believe *Hannibal* offers a different dynamic in midfield, with potential for box-to-box contributions, pressing, and creativity, replacing the outgoing *Ethan Galbraith*. His current rating (76) and potential (81) make him a valuable addition to my squad.

### Key Outgoing Transfers

*   ***Ethan Galbraith***
    *   New club: **Burnley** (part of *Hannibal* deal)
    *   Transfer fee: Part-exchange for *Hannibal* (+ £7.6M cash)
*   Rationale: *Galbraith* played a lot of games over the past seasons, making him one of my most featured players. That being said, *Galbraith*'s overall rating has hit a plateau at 73, making him unlikely to be able to compete at the top flight. I saw the swap deal as a tactical upgrade for my midfield.

### Impact of the Winter Transfer Window

The window saw a significant overhaul, particularly noteworthy for my substantial investment in *Ben Doak*. This indicates my focus on acquiring high-potential talent to take the team to the next level. While losing key players like *Harry Myers* and *Ethan Galbraith* is impactful, I brought in the incoming players as direct replacements or upgrades. My overall aim appears to be increasing the quality of the first XI, especially in attack and defense.

Crucially, I enhanced the quality of depth with significant signings, which is vital for a promotion push and potential Premier League campaign. Losing several players who featured regularly (*Galbraith*, *Horváth*, *Meghoma*, *Wilson*, *Florenzi*) means my new signees will need to rapidly integrate and fill those voids.

Financially, the impact was incredibly positive. The total transfer income was a staggering £85,590,000 against total transfer spending of £77,700,000. 

This resulted in a net profit of approximately £7.89 million, alongside improving the squad's quality. This demonstrates my shrewd financial management, turning player sales (especially *Harry Myers*) into highly targeted and impactful investments.

## Conclusion

The first half of Season 3 has been a period of immense progress for **Leyton Orient**. Our strong league position, coupled with the strategic movements I made in the winter transfer window, has set us up perfectly for the remainder of the campaign. I am determined to maintain this momentum, integrate the new signings seamlessly, and push relentlessly for that coveted automatic promotion spot. The journey is far from over, but the signs are incredibly promising.
