# Chapter 12: The Promotion Push - Half-Season Review & Winter Transfers

## Introduction

The first half of our third season has been an exhilarating rollercoaster. We've battled through the relentless grind of the Championship and, as we head into the second half of the season, we find ourselves in the thick of a fierce promotion battle. The dream of Premier League football is no longer a distant ambition; it's within our grasp. This is a review of our journey so far—the highs, the lows, and the critical moves we made in January to turn that dream into a reality.

## Season 3: First Half Performance – A Promotion Push

The first half of Season 3 saw us, **Leyton Orient**, establish ourselves as serious contenders for automatic promotion. By the end of January 2027, and carrying into February, I was thrilled to see us achieve a remarkable 2nd place in the EFL Championship, standing with 74 points from 32 games. We trailed **Ipswich** by a mere 2 points (76 points), a testament to our exceptionally strong start and consistent form.

### Cup Competitions

The cup campaigns provided mixed fortunes but valuable experience:

* **Carabao Cup:** I was pleased with our strong form, as we progressed through multiple rounds.
    * Round 1: A convincing 2-0 victory against **Oxford United** in August 2026.
    * Round 2: A dominant 3-0 win over **Blackburn** in late August 2026.
    * Round 3: Our journey concluded in a narrow 2-1 defeat to Premier League giants **Manchester City** in late September 2026. This was a commendable run against top-tier opposition, demonstrating our growing capabilities. Our only goal scored was a wonder freekick from distant by *Will Lankshear*.

* **FA Cup:** Our FA Cup campaign was short-lived, with an early exit.
    * Round 4: A 1-0 loss to **Wrexham** in late January 2027.

### Memorable Matches

The league campaign was filled with highs and a few challenging moments for me:

* **Wins:**
  * Significant cup wins against **Oxford United** (2-0, Carabao R1) and **Blackburn** (3-0, Carabao R2) showcased our ability to perform on the knockout stage.
  * A commanding 4-0 home win against **Watford** in September 2026.
  * A crucial 3-1 away win against **Cardiff** in November 2026.
  * A dominant 5-0 home win against **Oxford United** in the league in late January 2027, demonstrating strong attacking prowess.

* **Losses:**
  * The narrow 2-1 Carabao Cup defeat to **Manchester City** in September 2026 stands out as a tough but respectable exit.
  * A 3-0 away loss to **Bristol City** in October 2026.
  * A 3-2 away loss to **Birmingham** in January 2027, marking a stumble at the start of the new year.
  * The FA Cup Fourth Round loss to **Wrexham** (1-0) in late January 2027.

* **Draws:**
  * Several draws, including 1-1 against **Oxford United** (August), 2-2 against **Reading** (August), 1-1 against **Hull** (October), and 1-1 against **Middlesbrough** (January), pointed to our tenacity but also highlighted missed opportunities to convert draws into wins.

### Tactical Successes and Challenges

Sitting in 2nd place by February is a testament to the dedication to winning. The attacking system I've implemented has been firing on all cylinders, with 75 goals scored in 39 matches. The team a joy to play with. Our ability to go toe-to-toe with strong opposition in the cups also proves our tactical flexibility. Defensively, we're getting stronger, with 14 clean sheets showing that the structure I'm building is starting to pay off.

However, conceding nearly a goal a game (37 in 39 matches) tells me we still have work to do. While the attack is winning us games, the defence is what will win us the title. We hit a rough patch in December and early January, and the losses to **Portsmouth**, **Sunderland**, and **Birmingham** were a stark reminder that this league is unforgiving. Managing fatigue and maintaining consistency is the biggest challenge for any manager in the Championship, and the early FA Cup exit was a lesson in juggling priorities.

## Key Player Performances

In a promotion push, you need your big players to step up, and several have been absolutely immense for me in the first half of the season:

* ***Will Lankshear:*** A revelation, leading the "Top Players" list with an outstanding 8.12 average rating and 8 Man of the Match awards. He is also the second top scorer with 15 goals despite only 15 appearances, highlighting clinical finishing.
* ***Jay Stansfield:*** Continues to be a pivotal figure as the top goal scorer with 20 goals and a very strong 7.57 average rating, earning 8 Man of the Match awards. He also contributed significantly to assists.
* ***Dele Alli:*** A key creative force, leading the team with 10 assists and contributing 6 goals from 24 appearances. His influence in midfield remains central.
* ***Jamie Donley:*** Maintained his creative output with 7 assists and contributed from his 26 appearances.
* ***Josh Keeley:*** The primary goalkeeper, recording 9 clean sheets and conceding 30 goals.
* ***Marko Stamenić:*** Demonstrated his importance in midfield with 29 appearances (most among outfield players) and 6 assists.
* ***Tyreece Simpson:*** Despite only 12 appearances, contributed 6 goals, showing promising attacking efficiency.
* ***Luka Vušković:*** A defensive presence, featuring in 24 games and even chipping in with 4 goals.

### Squad Trimming and Setbacks

Not every player is going to fit into the long-term vision, and with 17 players departing since the end of last season, it's clear we made some tough decisions to streamline the squad. Some were moved on to make way for upgrades, while others simply didn't fit the high-intensity system I demand. While our attack has been prolific, conceding 37 goals is a number that keeps me up at night. It's a team issue, and we're constantly working on our defensive shape and discipline.

Just as we were building momentum, we were hit with a major blow. Our key backup right-back, *Rosas*, suffered a long-term injury right around Christmas. It was a devastating setback that not only robbed us of a key player but also forced my hand in the January transfer market, making a new right-back an unexpected top priority.

## Winter Transfer Window (January 2027)

January was a critical month. To get over the line, I knew we needed to be decisive in the transfer market. It wasn't just about adding bodies; it was about making strategic additions who could provide the quality and spark needed for the final, grueling months of the season. Every signing was made with one eye on promotion and the other on building a squad capable of competing in the Premier League.

### Key Incoming Transfers

#### Ben Doak

* Position: RM / RW (Winger)
* Age: 20
* Previous club: **Inter** (Lombardia FC)
* Transfer fee: £28.9M (Value: €31M, Wage: €55K)

A massive investment signaling my clear intent for promotion. I see *Doak* as an explosive attacking talent to bolster **Leyton Orient's** forward line, potentially adding pace, flair, and direct goal threat crucial for a promotion push and future Premier League aspirations. His high potential (86) and current rating (78) make him a key long-term asset for me.

*Doak* was at **Inter** when I made the approach, but he wasn't getting much game time there. **Inter** plays a 5-3-2 with two wing-backs. Crucially, *Doak* was being deployed primarily as a backup CAM, a role he isn't naturally suited for. While a move to **Leyton Orient** might seem a step down on paper, I was confident it would offer him the regular game time he craved in a highly competitive league, allowing him to truly flourish.

#### Hannibal

* Position: CM / CAM (Midfielder)
* Age: 23
* Previous club: **Burnley**
* Transfer fee: *Ethan Galbraith* + £7.6M (part-exchange deal, valuing *Galbraith* at around £8M as well) (Value: €11.5M, Wage: €41K)

A swap deal that brings in a versatile, high-energy midfielder. I believe *Hannibal* offers a different dynamic in midfield, with potential for box-to-box contributions, pressing, and creativity, replacing the outgoing *Ethan Galbraith*. His current rating (76) and potential (81) make him a valuable addition to my squad.

### Key Outgoing Transfers - Ethan Galbraith

* New club: **Burnley** (part of *Hannibal* deal)
* Transfer fee: Part-exchange for *Hannibal* (+ £7.6M cash)

*Galbraith* played a lot of games over the past seasons, making him one of my most featured players. That being said, *Galbraith*'s overall rating has hit a plateau at 73, making him unlikely to be able to compete at the top flight. I saw the swap deal as a tactical upgrade for my midfield.

### Impact of the Winter Transfer Window

This window was all about raising the ceiling of the squad. The investment in *Ben Doak* was a clear signal of our intent—we're not just here to participate; we're here to win. Losing players who have been important for us, like *Ethan Galbraith*, is always tough, but my job is to make difficult decisions for the good of the club. The players I brought in were chosen to be immediate upgrades and to increase the quality of our starting XI.

Strengthening our depth was just as crucial. The Championship is a marathon, and a strong bench can be the difference between automatic promotion and the playoff lottery. The new signings will need to hit the ground running, but I have full confidence in them.

Financially, we played it smart. To walk away with a net profit of nearly £8 million while significantly improving the squad is a testament to our strategy. We turned the major sale in summer of *Harry Myers* into targeted investments that make us stronger, both now and for the future.

## Conclusion

The first half of the season was a success, but it was just the beginning. Our league position is strong, and the squad is deeper and more talented after the winter window. Now, the real work begins. We have to integrate the new signings, maintain our momentum, and show the relentless consistency that promotion campaigns are built on. The journey is far from over, and there will be more twists and turns, but I believe in this team. The signs are promising, and we are ready for the fight.
