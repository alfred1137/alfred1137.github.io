# Quarterly Review

As we reach November in our journey, we find ourselves a quarter of the way through the season. With 17 matches played across all competitions, it's the perfect time to take stock of our progress and challenges.

## Introducing Our Squad

I'm proud to present our squad for the 2025/26 season. We've maintained our trusted 4-2-3-1 formation that served us well in our promotion campaign.

Our attacking prowess centres around the dynamic partnership between striker *Jay Stansfield* and shadow striker *Dele Alli*. This lethal combination has become the cornerstone of our offensive strategy. 

Supporting this duo, we've deployed two attacking midfielders who operate brilliantly in the half spaces, creating a fluid and unpredictable attacking system that consistently challenges opposition defences.

## The Season So Far

### EFL Championship

We currently sit in 7th place with 22 points from 13 matches, having recorded 7 wins, 1 draw, and 5 losses. Our goal difference stands at +1, with 17 goals scored and 16 conceded.

It's worth noting that our loss ratio has increased significantly compared to last season, highlighting the step up in quality that the Championship presents.

**Sheffield United** currently top the league with 31 points, setting the pace for the rest of us. The teams ahead of us in the table are:
- **Middlesborough** (27 points)
- **Ipswich Town** (26 points)
- **Millwall** (25 points)
- **Wolverhampton Wanderers** (24 points)
- **West Bromwich Albion** (24 points)

The competition is incredibly tight, with **Southampton**, **Swansea City**, and **Preston North End** all just one point behind us on 21 points.

### Carabao Cup

Our Carabao Cup campaign came to an early end after drawing Premier League side **Newcastle United** in the third round. The quality gap was evident as the O's were blown out of the water in a 5-2 defeat. This result shows we still have some way to go before we're at Premier League level, but the experience was valuable for our squad.

## Also in the News...

In a surprising development, *Inzaghi* received an offer from **Borussia Dortmund** to become their head coach, with a tempting salary package of over 120,000 euros per week. After careful consideration, I decided to reject the offer. My commitment remains unwavering – I'm determined to guide **Leyton Orient** to the top flight of English football.

### Standout Performers

The step up to the Championship has been a test of character for our squad, but several players have risen to the challenge magnificently. Let's spotlight those who've made the biggest impact in our campaign so far:

*Jay Stansfield*: Our Talisman

What a revelation *Stansfield* has been! With 6 goals and 5 assists in just 14 appearances, he's been directly involved in nearly half of our total goals. His average rating of 7.71 is exceptional at this level, and he's claimed 3 Man of the Match awards – more than anyone else in the squad. His movement, finishing, and ability to bring others into play have made him indispensable to our attacking threat.

*Mikey Moore*: The Creative Spark

At just 18 years old, *Moore* has shown maturity beyond his years, contributing 5 goals in 13 appearances and earning 2 Man of the Match awards. His ability to find space between the lines and deliver in crucial moments has been a joy to watch. With an average rating of 6.81, he's proving that his permanent transfer from **Spurs** was money well spent.

*Josh Keeley*: The Wall

Our defensive record has been bolstered significantly by *Keeley* between the sticks. With 9 clean sheets in 17 matches and an impressive average rating of 7.05, he's been the foundation upon which our defensive stability has been built. His shot-stopping abilities have saved us countless points already this season.

*Dele Alli*: The Experienced Head

The former England international continues to demonstrate his class, notching 3 goals in 12 appearances. His leadership on the pitch and ability to control the tempo of games has been crucial as we've adapted to life in the Championship.

*Alexis Gutiérrez* & *Jamie Donley*: The Creators

Both midfielders have been excellent providers, with *Gutiérrez* and *Donley* contributing 3 assists each. Their vision and technical ability have been key to unlocking stubborn Championship defences.

Emerging Talents

*Will Lankshear* deserves a special mention with an impressive 7.51 average rating in his 7 appearances, while *James Wilson* has also shown promise with a 7.39 rating in limited game time. These players represent the depth we've built in the squad and will be crucial as we navigate the demanding Championship schedule.
