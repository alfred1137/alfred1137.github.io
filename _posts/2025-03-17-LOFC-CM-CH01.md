## Summer of Change: The Inzaghi Revolution Begins

Arriving in June 2024, I knew immediate action was needed. The squad required a significant overhaul to implement my tactical vision – a dynamic, attacking style built on a solid defensive foundation.

## Transfer Activity

Here's a summary of the comings and goings at Brisbane Road during the summer transfer window:

| Transfer Type | Player Name(s) | Notes |
| :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Ins (Permanent)** | Aaron Nemane (£370K), Tyler Bindon (£2.5M) | Strategic paid transfers to strengthen key positions |
| **Ins (Free Agents)** | Jesus Angulo, Alexis Vega, Florinel Coman, Erik Lira, Mihály Kata, Elijah Just, Bogdan Mykhailichenko | Exploiting free transfer market for high-quality players |
| **Ins (Loans)** | Dele Alli (Como), Will Lankshear (Tottenham), Jamie Donley (Tottenham), Dilan Markanday (Blackburn), Jack Currie (Oxford United) | Strategic loan signings to add depth |
| **Outs (Permanent)** | Sam Howes (£150K), Noah Phillips (£250K), Darren Pratley (£89K), Jordan Brown (£850K), Tom James (£450K), Jordan Graham (£500K), Dan Happe (£700K), Dan Agyei (£550K), Jayden Sweeney (£530K) | Generated £4.07M in sales |
| **Outs (Loans)** | Azeem Abdulai (Cambridge), Zech Obiero (USL Dunkerque), Charlie Pegrum (Northampton) | Youth development loans |

### Exploiting Free Transfers: A Double-Edged Sword

You'll notice that I extensively exploited the free transfer market to strengthen the squad. Many of these free agents are national team players who previously played in leagues not currently represented in the game. However, this approach comes with two significant downsides. First, their wage demands are substantially higher than the team average, as evident in the squad table below. Second, and more problematically from a gameplay perspective, their player ratings (70+) are significantly higher than the rest of the team (who average around 65).

To maintain competitive balance and fairness, I plan to transfer out some of these overpowered players when we receive suitable offers from other clubs when we are in the January 2025 transfer window.

## Tactical Approach: The 4-2-3-1 meta

We're employing a 4-2-3-1 formation, designed to be both defensively solid and creatively potent in attack. Here's a look at the key roles within the system:

* **Striker:** The focal point of the attack, tasked with leading the line, making runs in behind, and finishing chances.
* **Wingers (LM/RM):** Playing as Inside Forwards, they'll cut inside onto their stronger foot to create goal-scoring opportunities or provide through balls to the striker.
* **Central Attacking Midfielder (CAM):** The creative hub of the team, linking play between midfield and attack, providing assists, and contributing goals.
* **Central Defensive Midfielders (CDMs):** One CDM (the holding midfielder) providing defensive cover, winning back possession, and shielding the back four. The other CDM (roaming playmaker) tasked with creating chances and dictating tempo.
* **Fullbacks:** Providing width in attack and defensive solidity.
* **Center Backs:** Primarily focused on defending, winning aerial duels, and organizing the backline.
* **Goalkeeper:** Providing shot-stopping prowess and being a reliable last line of defence.

## Financial Stability

## Early Season Form: A Promising Start

As of the time of the release of this Chapter 01, we are in mid-October in game. We have played 18 games so far, including 11 League One games, and 7 Cup ties or friendlies.

The results have been encouraging so far! We boast a record of 14 wins, 2 draws, and just 2 losses. We are banging in the goals, with 26 scored, and a mean defence with only 3 conceded, the biggest win so far has been a 4-0 drubbing of Rotherham in August, but we suffered a 1-0 set back at Bolton in September.

Here below is a summary of the performance so far.

## What's Next?

The journey is just beginning! The focus now is on maintaining our momentum, developing our young talent, and continuing to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window. The dream is promotion, and we're determined to make it a reality.

Stay tuned for future updates, including match analysis, transfer news, and insights into our tactical approach.
