## Custom Squad Registration Rules: Raising the Bar

With the kits unveiled, it's time to turn our attention to the composition of the squad that will wear them with pride. 

As many top leagues have introduced squad registration rules to promote the development of locally grown players and restrict teams from simply spending their way to success, I felt it necessary to implement similar restrictions. 

To reflect this and further increase the challenge of competing in the Championship, I have adopted a blend of rules inspired by the English, Spanish, and Italian systems. These self-imposed restrictions will force us to be smarter and more strategic in the transfer market, place greater emphasis on nurturing talent from our academy, and prioritize youth development initiatives.

The rules we will adhere to from the 2025/26 season onwards are as follows:

| Category          | Sub-category             | Type     | No. of Players | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Homegrown Players** |                          | **Min**  | **8**          | A minimum number of players who qualify as 'Homegrown'.                                                                                                                                                 |
|                   | _Club-Trained Players_   | _Min_    | _2_            | Players developed within the Leyton Orient youth academy for at least 3 years before turning 21. These are the heart of the club.                                                                       |
|                   | _Association-Trained Players_ | _Min_    | _6_            | Players developed at clubs affiliated with the English or Welsh FAs for at least 3 years total before turning 21. These supplement our academy products.                                             |
| **Foreign Players** |                          | **Max**  | **5**          | A strict limit on non-homegrown players (excluding U21s) in the registered squad, encouraging the integration and development of domestic talent.                                                     |
| **U-21 Players**    |                          | No Limit | N/A            | Players under the age of 21 do not need to be registered in the main squad list, allowing for unlimited integration of young talent and providing crucial first-team opportunities without restriction. |

## Navigating the Summer Transfer Window

Our transfer strategy this summer will continue the principles established last season. Financial responsibility is paramount, and any incoming transfers must align with our budget and the new squad registration rules.

We will remain pragmatic; if offers arrive for players that meet or exceed our valuation, we will consider letting them go. This approach is crucial for generating funds to reinvest smartly, particularly given the need to strengthen the squad for the higher demands of the Championship. All previously established 'house rules' regarding transfers still apply.

Stepping up to the Championship presents a significant challenge on multiple fronts.
